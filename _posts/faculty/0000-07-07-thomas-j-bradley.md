I love codeâ€”and design, of course. I grew up in the country, in Pakenham, Ontario, and was always drawing schematics, making things on the computer, and creating LEGO spaceships! I strive to help communicate technical subjects to students in a clear and understandable way because I believe learning to code is extremely empowering. I have a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Fine Arts and Digital Media from York University and a Graduate Certificate in Interactive Multimedia from Algonquin College.
